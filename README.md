## Description

This website allows users to search for recipes using Spoonacular, save their favorite meals, and generate a grocery list based on selected recipes. Instead of using multiple APIs, we make two separate requests to Spoonacular:
Fetch recipes based on user search queries
Retrieve the ingredient details for selected recipes to build a structured grocery list
Additionally, users can upload and manage images for their saved recipes and grocery items using Cloudinary, making meal planning more interactive and visually engaging.
The goal is to streamline meal planning and grocery shopping by providing an easy-to-use platform that integrates recipe discovery, grocery list management, and image storage into one seamless experience.

## User Story
